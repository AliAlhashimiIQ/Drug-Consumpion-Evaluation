# Drug Consumption Evaluation

## Overview
This project aims to evaluate drug consumption patterns using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We analyze the data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Drug Consumption dataset from the UCI repository.

## Installation
1. I will be using jupyter
2. by going to command then pip install jupyter
    
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt:
    ```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly


## Usage
1. To preprocess the data and perform EDA, run:
    ```sh
    python scripts/preprocess_and_eda.py
    ```
2. To train the models, run:
    ```sh
    python scripts/train_model.py
    ```
3. To evaluate the models, run:
    ```sh
    python scripts/evaluate_models.py
    ```
all of em in the notebook jupyter file

## File Descriptions
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `
- `scripts/train_modescripts/preprocess_and_eda.py`: Script for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.ls.py`: Script for training the machine learning models.
- `scripts/evaluate_models.py`: Script for evaluating the trained models.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Results
- Summary of key findings from the EDA.
- Performance metrics of the trained models, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
